# AstroTeach
A website that teaches astronomy!!

## Client
This is the frontend, and where all of the HTML will go via React components.

## Server
This is the backend, where we connect to the database and send API requests.

## Test
This is where we will design and test out the HTML before putting it into the frontend.

## Running the website
1. Open up a terminal and CD into the server folder. In there, type `npm start`
2. Open up another terminal, CD into the client folder, and type `npm start` as well
3. Wait for everything to compile, and head to localhost:3000
